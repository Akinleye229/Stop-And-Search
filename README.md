https://data.police.uk/ is the site for open data about crime and policing in England,
Wales, and Northern Ireland. A publicly available API provides detailed crime data
and information about individual police forces and neighbourhood teams. The
documentation for this API can be found at https://data.police.uk/docs/
It is possible to list out stop and searches by force, full details on this method can be
found at https://data.police.uk/docs/method/stops-force/
I Used  to Python retrieve data from the API in oder to process it, and then I
visualise using Matplotlib.
